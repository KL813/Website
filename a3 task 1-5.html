                        It is one of the most common and dangerous web security vulnerabilities. The steps are as follows:
                        1-Identification and Injection: A hacker identifies a vulnerable website that relies on SQL-driven input fields. The hacker injects malicious SQL queries into these input fields.
                        2-Execution: The website validates the malicious SQL query and executes the command on the database.
                        3-Access and Manipulation: The hacker gains access to the database, allowing them to view, alter, or delete records, potentially gaining administrative privileges over the database.

                    <td>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of attack where malicious code is injected into a vulnerable web application. Unlike attacks that target the web application itself, XSS focuses 
                        on compromising users who interact with the app. The consequences of XSS can be severe, affecting a business's reputation and user trust. Attacks can lead to compromised user accounts, 
                        activation of malicious software, altered page content, and exposure of session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate users.
                        There are two main types of XSS attacks:
                        Stored XSS (Persistent XSS): Malicious code is injected directly into the web application and can affect all users who access it  
                        Reflected XSS: The malicious script is embedded in a link and only activated when the user clicks the link, reflecting the attack off the web application onto the user's browser.

                        This flood of requests disrupts the normal operation of the target, leading to a denial-of-service for legitimate users.
                        Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a subtype of DoS attacks that come from multiple sources, often using a network of compromised devices (botnets) to amplify the attack.
                        DoS attacks generally fall into two categories:
                        1.Buffer Overflow Attacks: These exploit memory buffers to consume excessive resources like disk space, memory, or CPU time, causing the system to slow down or crash.
                        2.Flood Attacks: These involve overwhelming a server with an excessive amount of data packets, saturating its capacity and making it unable to handle legitimate traffic. Success typically depends on the attacker having more bandwidth than the target.

                    <td>Phishing is a type of attack where a malicious actor tries to steal sensitive information, like usernames, passwords, or credit card details, by pretending to be a trustworthy source. The goal is to trick the victim into providing their information, 
                        similar to how a fisherman uses bait to catch fish.
                        Phishing is often carried out through deceptive emails or instant messages that mimic legitimate organisations. It is commonly used to facilitate other attacks, such as on-path or cross-site scripting attacks.
                        Common examples include:
                        1-Spear Phishing: Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or companies using personalised information to create convincing scams. It accounts for over 90% of phishing attacks.
                        2-Clone Phishing: A tactic where a previously legitimate email is replicated and modified with malicious links or attachments to deceive the victim into accessing harmful content.
                        3-Whaling: Phishing attacks directed at high-level executives or senior officials, often involving urgent or important-sounding requests to exploit their authority and bypass security checks.

                        The main goal is to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card numbers, from users of financial services, SaaS platforms, e-commerce sites, and other login-required websites. 
                        This stolen information can be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, or other malicious activities. Additionally, MITM attacks can help attackers infiltrate secure networks as part of a larger, advanced persistent threat (APT) assault. 
                        Essentially, a MITM attack is like a mailman secretly opening your bank statement, copying your account details, 
                        and then resealing and delivering the envelope as if nothing happened.

                         most are now executed by bots using lists of commonly used or real user credentials obtained from breaches or the dark web.

                    <td>Session hijacking is an attack where a malicious actor takes control of a user's web session by stealing or manipulating the session token, which ensures secure and continuous communication between the user and a website. 
                        Once the attacker intercepts this token, they can impersonate the user and access their information or services, often leading to fraud, identity theft, and breaches of confidential communications. How it works: 
                        Attackers capture, brute force, or reverse-engineer session IDs to take over an active user session, gaining complete access to the user's data and permissions.
                        Techniques for Session Hijacking:
                        1-Brute Force: Trying multiple session IDs until one works.
                        2-Calculate: Exploiting non-randomly generated IDs.

                    <td>DNS tunneling is a stealthy attack where DNS requests are rerouted to an attacker's server, creating a covert channel for command and control (C&C) and data exfiltration. DNS functions like the internet's phonebook,
                        translating domain names into IP addresses. Attackers exploit this by encoding small C&C messages or data into DNS queries and responses. 
                        How DNS Tunneling Works:
                        1-An attacker sets up a server with malware and a domain pointing to it.
                        2-They infect a host with malware, which then queries the attacker's domain.
                        3-The DNS resolver routes the query, establishing a tunnel between the attacker and the target. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate data or remotely control the host.
                        DNS tunneling is hard to detect because DNS traffic is naturally noisy, making it difficult to differentiate between normal and malicious activity.

                    <td>A drive-by attack, or drive-by download, is a cyberattack where malicious software installs itself on a user's device without their explicit permission, 
                        often occurring when the user visits a compromised webpage. These attacks utilise exploit kits to identify vulnerabilities in the user's system 
                        and initiate the download automatically. They can occur without any user interaction or through deceptive means, such as disguised buttons or links. 
                        The primary goal of drive-by attacks is to infect devices, steal information, or damage data, exploiting weaknesses in web browsers or devices.

                    <td>A zero-day exploit targets an unknown or unpatched security flaw in software, hardware, or firmware. The term "zero-day" means that the vendor has zero days to fix the flaw because it is already being exploited by attackers.
                        1-Zero-Day Vulnerability: An unaddressed security flaw.
                        2-Zero-Day Attack: An attack using a zero-day exploit to cause damage.
                        3-Zero-Day Malware: Malware with an unknown signature, making it undetectable by many antivirus programs.
                        4-Zero-Day Lifecycle:
                        -A flaw exists but is undiscovered.
                        -It may be found by researchers or hackers.
                        -Once discovered, it becomes public, prompting a rush to fix it.
                        -Hackers may exploit it before a patch is available.
                        Some examples of Zero-Day Attacks:
                        1-Stuxnet: A worm that used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to damage Iranian nuclear centrifuges in 2010.
                        2-Log4Shell: A flaw in the Log4J library that allowed remote control of devices; exploited in 2021.
                        3-2022 Chrome Attacks: North Korean hackers exploited a Chrome vulnerability to install spyware through phishing emails.
